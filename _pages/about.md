Welcome to my webpage!

I'm a PhD student in [Technology and Operations Management](https://www.insead.edu/phd/academics-and-research/technology-operations-management), INSEAD.

My current reasearch interests lie in revenue management and pricing optimization, as well as sustainable operations management. I'm particularly passionate about the dynamics of pricing problems, such as incentive design, multi-product pricing and dynamic pricing, in online platforms. Additionally, I'm concerned with the sustainable development of platform economies, especially in terms of social responsibility and energy-efficient technologies. I am also interested in data-driven optimization and decision-making under uncertainty, and I am eager to explore how these techniques can be applied to the areas mentioned.
