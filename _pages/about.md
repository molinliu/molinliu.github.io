I'm currently a _postgraduate student_ from [Department of Industrial Engineering and Management](https://ieem.sjtu.edu.cn/en/), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn), where I received my _bachelor's degree_ in 2021. 
From 2019 to 2021, I studied at [Ecole Centrale Sup√©lec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr) as a _double diplome student_.

My research interests are within the field of _operations research_, _mathematical modeling_ and _combinatorial optimization_. I am particularly interested in scheduling problems which arise from manufacturing system and maintenance system, such as the flexible job shop scheduling and metro maintenance scheduling. And I am currently exploring the price optimization problem with uncertainty.
