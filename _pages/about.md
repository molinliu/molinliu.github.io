Welcome to my webpage!

I'm a PhD student in [Technology and Operations Management](https://www.insead.edu/phd/academics-and-research/technology-operations-management), INSEAD.

My current research interests lie in the design and operations of platform economies. I'm particularly passionate about the dynamics of pricing and information disclosure within these systems.
