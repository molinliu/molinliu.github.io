I'm currently a postgraduate student from [Department of Industrial Engineering and Management](https://ieem.sjtu.edu.cn/en/), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/). I received my bachelor's degree in Industrial Engineering from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) in 2021. From 2019 to 2021, I was in [Université Paris-Saclay Centrale Supélec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr) as a double diplome student.

My research interests are within the field of operations research, mathematical modeling and combinatorial optimization. I am particularly interested in scheduling problems which arise from manufacturing system and maintenance system, such as the flexible job shop scheduling and metro maintenance scheduling. I am also exploring the price optimization problem with the methods of counterfactual inference and discrete choice model.
