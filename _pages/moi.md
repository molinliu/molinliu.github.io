## Research Experiences

* **Operations Research Internship at Alibaba Group**, 2023.06 - 2023.09
  * Investigated classic and frontier research methods in the field of **price optimisation**, covering economic modelling,
causal inference, integer programming and robust optimization.
  * Proposed a novel methodology to handle with the **multi-threshold incentive allocation problem** targeting on takeaway riders, where
an integer programming model with limited elasticity data was formulated and simplified.
  * Attempted **robust optimization** with ellipsoidal uncertainty sets to address the uncertainty of predicted parameters.
* **Intelligent Production Scheduling Program**, 2021.07 - 2023.06
  * Cooperated with a leading domestic engine manufacturer to develop a set of **intelligent production scheduling**
algorithms for the advanced planning and scheduling system in its _New Product Development Center_.
  * The algorithms realized: pre-scheduling and order splitting to meet resource constraints; advanced static schedul-
ing suitable for highly flexible production scenarios; dynamic scheduling for various exceptional situations
  * Workshop management efficiency was effectively improved and management costs were highly reduced.
* **Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSP) with Fixture-pallet Constraints**, 2022.06 - 2023.02
  * Formulated a mixed integer programming model to solve **FJSP with multi-resource constraints**, aiming to minimize
makespan and find optimal fixture-pallet combination mode simultaneously.
  * Proposed a feasibility repair strategy to address potential coupling conflicts between machines and fixtures and
designed a self-learning variable neighbourhood search to further improve algorithm performance.
  * Proved the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms by cases derived from real production scenarios.
* **Operations Research Internship at Cardinal Operations**, 2022.10 - 2023.01
  * Participated in **Shanghai Metro Maintenance Scheduling Program** and got familiar with existing algorithm logic.
  * Developed a heuristic algorithm for overhaul scheduling of entire metro network, which incorporated factors such as contractor’s maintenance capacity, minimum operational requirements for each line, and maintenance interval.
  * An optimal metro repair plan could be made within minutes, reducing the maintenance costs.
* **Airline Crew Scheduling Problem**, 2021.09 - 2021.10
  * Developed a mixed integer programming model, considering complex factors such as crew members’ qualifications, crew member bases, flight assignments, flight duration, destinations, task dependencies, and other constraints.
  * Utilized the Gurobi solver to perform modeling and optimization, and devised a heuristic algorithm based on greedy and depth-first search, whose efficiency and accuracy were validated through numerical experiments.
  * Awarded the **Second Prize (Top 10%)** in the _18th ”Huawei Cup” Graduate Mathematical Modeling Competition_.
