## Education
* Ph.D. in Technology and Operations Management, **INSEAD**, Fontainebleau, 2024 - Ongoing

* MEng in Industrial Engineering and Management, **Shanghai Jiao Tong University**, Shanghai, 2021 - 2024

* Diplôme d'ingénieur, **Centrale Supélec - Université Paris-Saclay**, Paris, 2019 - 2021

* BEng in Industrial Engineering, **Shanghai Jiao Tong University**, Shanghai, 2016 - 2021


## Research Experiences

* **Production Scheduling in Flexible Manufacturing Systems**, 2021 - 2024
  * Collaborated with a leading domestic engine manufacturer to develop intelligent production scheduling algorithms for the advanced planning system at its _New Product Development Center_.
  * Conducted research work on the **multi-resource constrained flexible job shop scheduling problem (FJSP)**:
    * FJSP with **fixture-pallet** combinatorial optimization.
    * FJSP considering multiple **Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV)** transportaion constraints.

* **Operations Research Internship at Alibaba Group**, 2023.06 - 2023.09
  * Contributed to an **incentive design project** focused on takeaway riders, exploring both classic and cutting-edge research methods in **price optimisation**, including economic modelling,
causal inference, and robust optimization.
  * Proposed a novel solution to the **multi-threshold incentive allocation problem**, formulating an integer programming model and applying robust optimization with ellipsoidal uncertainty sets to handle limited elasticity data and parameter uncertainty.


* **Operations Research Internship at Cardinal Operations**, 2022.10 - 2023.01
  * Participated in **Shanghai Metro Maintenance Scheduling Program** and developed a heuristic algorithm for overhaul scheduling of entire metro network, accounting for contractor capacity, operational requirements, and maintenance interval.
  * An optimal metro repair plan could be made within minutes, reducing the maintenance costs.
